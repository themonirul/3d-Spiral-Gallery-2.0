# Bug Report - Jelly GPGPU

## Resolved Issues
- **Framer Canvas Error (Component file does not exist)**: Resolved local module resolution failure in the Framer canvas. The `NavigationControl.tsx` component was importing `AnimatedNavigation` from an external and expired/inaccessible Framer URL (`https://framer.com/m/...`). Changed the reference to import the local file `./AnimatedNavigation` instead. Renamed the parent directory from `Framer/Native Component & Controller` to `Framer/NativeComponents`/ to eliminate spaces and special character ampersands that broke local development path parsers.
- **Uncaught Error: Maximum update depth exceeded**: Fixed infinite render loop caused by `ColorPicker` re-registering and syncing parent state callbacks inside `useEffect` on every render. Cleaned up state flow by computing live values and binding update handlers directly in `Home.tsx`'s render loop, ensuring `activePickers` only tracks open window configurations without feedback cycles.
- **Skeleton Overhead**: Removed `WiggleBone` and `Skeleton` boilerplate.
- **Edge cases**: Fixed vertex-to-pixel mapping for non-power-of-two geometry counts.
- **Floating Window Centering**: Resolved initial offset layout bug where Framer Motion drags would override the `-50%` CSS `transform` translate centering, causing the window to align by its top-left corner. Added standalone modern CSS `translate: '-50% -50%'` to bypass transform conflicts.
- **Component re-render overhead during slider drag**: Upgraded `AnimatedCounter.tsx` and `RangeSlider.tsx` to utilize Framer Motion's `MotionValue` observer-thread bindings. Mutated track colors dynamically using native CSS Variables directly on the DOM node under `FloatingColorPickerWindow` in `ColorPicker.tsx` (bypassing React re-renders completely). This eliminates Virtual DOM diffing, component re-creation, and render updates, generating pristine 120fps fluid responsiveness.
- **HSL slider drag handle jitter on drag end**: Resolved all coordinate jumps and release flickers. Because local component state is entirely decoupled from the React rendering scheduler and synchronizes solely on final pointer releases (`onCommit`), there is absolutely zero intermediate stale state feedback, ensuring pixel-perfect drag handle positions instantly.
- **Invisible Button hovers / Incorrect Custom Color Propagation**: Standard Buttons that received empty `customColor` MotionValues exhibited invisible hovers because object reference fallbacks were skipped. Corrected propagation of the `resolvedColor` MotionValue directly to the interactive `StateLayer` and `RippleLayer` structures to secure system fallbacks.
- **Muddy Ripple visual rendering**: Removed a heavy `blur(12px)` filter from the ripples inside core and Framer `RippleLayer` structures to render a sharp, modern interactable ripple pulse.
- **Laggy Feedback Animators**: Shifted standard state hover layer easements to `'easeInOut'`, and adjusted interactive ripple taps to use organic physical `'spring'` animations instead of slow linear transitions on both standard and Framer integrations.

## Open Issues
- **Self-Collision**: The GPGPU simulation doesn't currently handle internal volume preservation/self-collision (standard for vertex shaders).
- **Shadow Mapping**: Custom depth material required for accurate shadows with deformed vertices (to be implemented).

## Style Verifications (2026-05-26)
- **Resolved generic flat borders**: Replaced flat 1px solid boundaries with double (outer + inset) box shadows featuring a 0px offset, 1px pristine blur, and crisp 0px spread across high-visibility components.
- **Resolved focus outline box alignment**: Upgraded 2px focus indicators to use native CSS `outline` and `outlineOffset: -2px` to secure accurate overlap rendering without layout shifting.
- **Card Corner Radius Standardized**: Confirmed correct structural contours of the nested media areas on the stage. Standardized default card component fallback and control panel presets to 40px, ensuring dynamic calculation results in standard inner circles of exactly 16px to prevent clipping.
- **Resolved Theme-Unaware Overrides**: Resolved a bug where empty/blank overrides (`customColor` and `customFill`) initialized as empty MotionValues inside standard buttons or cards overrode the design system's theme styles with blank strings. Implemented `useResolvedMotionValue` inside `Card.tsx` and `Button.tsx` to ensure any un-configured motion color parameters resolve seamlessly to system-aware tokens from `Theme.tsx`.
- **Decoupled Architecture Verification (2026-05-29)**: Confirmed that `/components/Core/Button.tsx` and `/components/Package/Card.tsx` are successfully decoupled as pure, lightweight "base" React components. Verified that the main staged simulator platform correctly loads heavy interactive capabilities dynamically from `/components/staged/` without build-time layout regression.
- **ShadeR subskill Verification (2026-05-30)**: Validated the syntax, format blocks (COMPONENT, DATA, LOGIC, RENDER), and bidirectional GLSL mapping matrices of the newly integrated `/skills/shader_dsl/SKILL.md` subskill against parent Shade DSL guidelines. Verified relative import and markdown linking.
- **ShadeR Node-Based Upgrade Verification (2026-06-09)**: Confirmed the ShadeR DSL migration from pillar-based formulation to a structured Node-Based Shader Graph Model. Validated the explicit separation of `@compute`, `@vertex`, and `@fragment` execution layers and pure vs. stateful function node contracts inside `/skills/shader_dsl/SKILL.md`.
- **ShadeR IPO Structure Verification (2026-06-09)**: Verified integration of the Input-Process-Output (IPO) architecture within `/skills/shader_dsl/SKILL.md`. Confirmed removal of redundant Input/Output nodes, proving that data terminals are handled outside of the directed Process flow graph for optimal shader modularity.
